As a child, Luffy ate the Devil Fruit known as the Gum-Gum Fruit, which granted him the ability to stretch his body like rubber. While the fruit gave him this extraordinary power, the sea can take it away and sink him. His goal is to find Gold Roger's treasure — the One Piece — and become King of the Pirates.
